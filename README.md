# Retail_Store
This is a retail project where our challenge is to predict whether a retail store should get opened or not based on certain factors such as sales, population,area etc.
We have given you two datasets , store_train.csv and store_test.csv . You need to use data store_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘store’. store_test data contains all other factors except ‘store’, you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.
